This Repo is for synthetic data generation for layerwise convolutional neural network compression

## Make Baseline Experiments

[] training with data
[] training with dataset that overlaps classes
[] training with dataset that minimally overlaps classes
[] training on random generated images

##Experiments

[x] naive maximization
[] augmentation tricks
[] diversity layerwise
[] gradient decent (what not to activate for)
[] gan?

##Related Work

[] Layer/Blockwise comrpession
[] semi supervised training
[] GAN knowledge distillation
