This Repo is for synthetic data generation for layerwise convolutional neural network compression

## Make Baseline Experiments

- [ ] training with data
- [ ] training with dataset that overlaps classes
- [ ] training with dataset that minimally overlaps classes
- [ ] training on random generated images

## Experiments

- [x] naive maximization
- [ ] augmentation tricks
- [ ] diversity layerwise
- [ ] gradient decent (what not to activate for)
- [ ] gan?

## Related Work
