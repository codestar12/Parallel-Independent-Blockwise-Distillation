This Repo is for synthetic data generation for layerwise convolutional neural network compression


many of the notebooks depend on the pretrained vgg16 and resnet50 fine-tuned on upscaled cifar10. For size reasons .h5 files are not tracked on this repo. If cloning you should download the .h5 files from google drive at the following links

## Make Baseline Experiments

- [ ] training with data
- [ ] training with dataset that overlaps classes
- [ ] training with dataset that minimally overlaps classes
- [ ] training on random generated images

## Experiments

- [x] naive maximization
- [ ] augmentation tricks
- [ ] diversity layerwise
- [ ] gradient decent (what not to activate for)
- [ ] gan?
